## üî¨ Research Projects

### [Assessing Out-of-the-Box Bioinformatics Capabilities of LLMs](projects/bioinformatics-llms/)
Evaluated the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4.0, and LLaMA 3-70B on over 100 bioinformatics problems. Compared results to tens of thousands of human participants using R and Python.

- **Skills**: Python, R, statistical modeling, data visualization, large language models, benchmarking  
- **Tools**: pandas, ggplot2, seaborn, NumPy

## Analytics Projects

### [IMDb Title and Genre Trends](projects/imdb-analysis/)
Explored patterns in IMDb data, such as genre distributions, actor prominence, and rating-vote relationships. Built a Shiny app with interactive filters and a mini-game.

- **Skills**: R, Shiny, ggplot2, dplyr, string processing, EDA  
- **Deliverables**: [Final Project](projects/imdb-analysis/imdb.pdf) 

### [German Gas Consumption Trends During the 2022 Energy Crisis](projects/german-gas/)
Analyzed time series data to show reductions in gas consumption across sectors. Found quicker adaptation in industry and strong correlation with temperature.

- **Skills**: R, time series analysis, statistical transformation, tidy data  
- **Libraries**: ggplot2, dplyr, lubridate
- **Deliverables**: [Midterm Project](projects/german-gas/gas.pdf) 

### [Election Voting Analysis](https://carteradamski.github.io/Election-Voting-Analysis/)
Used geospatial and socioeconomic data to explore 2020 voter trends by county. Modeled patterns with logistic regression and random forests.

- **Skills**: Python, geospatial data, machine learning, regression modeling  
- **Tools**: scikit-learn, pandas, geopandas, matplotlib
- **Website**: [Election Analysis](https://carteradamski.github.io/Election-Voting-Analysis/)

## Software Engineering Projects

### [Euchre Game Engine (C++)](projects/euchre/)
Simulated a full card game using C++ object-oriented principles like inheritance and polymorphism.

- **Skills**: C++, OOP, operator overloading, inheritance  
- **Code:** [Card.cpp](projects/euchre/card.cpp) | [player.cpp](projects/euchre/player.cpp) | [pack.cpp](projects/euchre/pack.cpp)| [player.cpp](projects/euchre/player.cpp)

### [Image Resizer](projects/image-resizer/)
Implemented a seam-carving image resizer with C-style structs and arrays.

- **Skills**: C++, dynamic memory, pointers, file I/O  
- **Code:** [image.cpp](projects/image-resizer/image.cpp) | [matrix.cpp](projects/image-resizer/matrix.cpp) | [processing.cpp](projects/image-resizer/processing.cpp) | [resize.cpp](projects/image-resizer/resize.cpp) 

### [Using Machine Learning to Identify Subject of Forum Posts](projects/forum-post-subject/)
Applied a Naive Bayes classifier implemented in C++ to categorize forum posts by subject, improving text classification accuracy.

- **Skills:** C++, text processing, Naive Bayes classification, file I/O  
- **Tools:** C++ STL, custom CSV parser
- **Code:** [classifier.cpp](projects/forum-post-subject/classifier.cpp)
